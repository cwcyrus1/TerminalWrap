# TerminalWrap
Terminal Wrapping for BlueJ - For formatting, NOT for auto-scaling or QoL improvements.

Project: BlueJWrap

Use:     To wrap text of Strings or Arrays in the BlueJ terminal window

Author:  Cyrus Wong, 11 March 2021

package: twrap

classes: TerminalWrap, DisplayInfo

modules: ConfigurationSetup

How it works, & Instructions:
    The package twrap does the following steps to determine the wrapping "threshold" - the display length of the string or array of objects being printed that is around half of the screen width
    - For each run, a new TerminalWrap instance is constructed, and performs the following:
      - Fetches the monitors/displays available on the device
      - Compares the data to that of the "TerminalWrapData.bisv" and "DisplayInformation.bisv" files
        - If there are any discrepancies, ConfigurationSetup is called by the TerminalWrap constructor
        - Prompts user to choose the screen/display they want the Strings to be formatted to, and requests the font size (default is 10)
          - If there is only one display, it is automatically chosen (no input required)
          - Where to see font size:
            - Inside of the Editor, Options -> Preferences
            - Inside of the Project Viewer, Tools -> Preferences
      - Overwrites the new data onto the two files, even if there are no discrepancies
      - The data fetched from "TerminalWrapData.bisv" file (after being re-written) are sent to the TerminalWrap constructor, where the values are separated and scaled according to logarithmic regression
        - Scales approximately from font size to pixel and uses that scaling to find monitor width (in pixels) to half of the width, in terms of String length
    - Uses the collected information to print and wrap text; after each call of the printWrap() method, the output automatically goes to a new line
    - If used for educational purposes, to maintain similar functionality to the printing of arrays element by element, have students append to a String what would normally be printed, and call "printWrap(String string, boolean equal)"
   
    Import Statement: ConfigurationSetup and DisplayInfo need not be imported; they are all accessed internally by TerminalWrap: "import twrap.TerminalWrap;"
   
    Download Files:
    - When the files for the package are downloaded, place them INSIDE of the folder where the java project (that you want to implement wrapping to) files are stored
    - When run, a check digit in the "TerminalWrapData.bisv" value is found, and allows for first-time setup - requests for monitor choice (if applicable) and font size
    - If there are no more hardware changes, every future run will not request for font size or display choice
      - To edit the configuration, run one of the following:
        - "TerminalWrap.editSetup()"
          - requests for monitor choice and font size again
        - "TerminalWrap.defaultSetup()"
          - sets the monitor choice to monitor 0 in the list, usually the built-in or primary display, and sets the font size to 10
    - If hardware changes are detected, the configuration setup will go again
    - For every run of the program, the data is checked and referenced
    - Information about the files:
      - "TerminalWrapData.bisv"
        - list of four integers: (1)-Monitor Choice; (2)-Unscaled Font Size; (3)-Check Value for first-time setup; (4)-Number of screens detected in the previous run
      - "DisplayInformation.bisv"
        - rows of information - one row for each display detected, records: (1)-Monitor reference number; (2)-Monitor width; (3)-Monitor height
   
    Syntax and Initialization:
    - To use, first import and initialize the following:
      - "import twrap.TerminalWrap;"
      - "TerminalWrap 'name' = new TerminalWrap()"
    - If data needs to be edited, call the class "TerminalWrap", rather than the object "'name'"; call before the object is constructed (first line in main)
